# 🔧 CORS Fix Applied

## ✅ Issue Identified
**Problem**: CORS policy blocking requests from `https://sharelist.netlify.app` to your Render backend

**Root Cause**: Backend CORS configuration didn't include your specific Netlify domain

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated SmartListController.java
- ✅ Added `https://sharelist.netlify.app` to allowed origins
- ✅ Kept existing localhost origins for development

### 2. Updated WebConfig.java  
- ✅ Added Netlify domain to CORS configuration source
- ✅ Updated both `addCorsMappings` and `corsConfigurationSource`

### 3. Fixed Frontend API Configuration
- ✅ Updated default backend URL to include `/api` path
- ✅ Changed from `https://your-backend-app.onrender.com` to `https://smartlist-backend.onrender.com/api`

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Push Changes
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Backend
- Go to Render dashboard
- Trigger manual deploy or it will auto-deploy from GitHub
- Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Test the Fix
Once redeployed, your frontend should be able to communicate with the backend without CORS errors.

## 🧪 Verification
After redeployment, check:
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ API requests from Netlify frontend work
- ✅ Lists can be created and viewed successfully

The CORS configuration now explicitly allows your Netlify domain! 🎉
